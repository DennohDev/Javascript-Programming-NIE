# Exercise 2: Comparison Operations
- **Objective:** Practice using JavaScript comparison operators.

### Instructions:

- Create an HTML file with a <script> tag where you will write your JavaScript code.
- Declare two variables, x and y, and assign them values (e.g., x = 15, y = 20).
- Perform the following comparisons and store the results in new variables:
    - Is x greater than y?
    - Is x less than y?
    - Is x equal to y?
    - Is x not equal to y?
- Display the results using console.log().
